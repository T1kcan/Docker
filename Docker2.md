# docker volume behaviours

|No    | Situation   | Behaviour |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1    | If there is no target directory. | The target directory is created and files inside volume are copied to this directory. |
| 2    | If there is target directory, but it is empty. | The files in volume are copied to target directory.  |
| 3    | If there is target directory and it is not empty, but volume is empty. | The files in the target directory are copied to volumes. |
| 4    | If the volume is not empty. | There will be just the files inside the volume regardless of the target directory is full or empty. |
